        <h3>Welcome to Daigler20!</h3>
        <p>
          Daigler20 (short for Daigler 2020) is the newly-setup Moodle server of
          Ateneo de Davao University's higher education unit. It serves as the
          official Learning Management System of the College as well as the
          Graduate School and the School of Law. It currently runs Moodle
          version 3.10. It also features a more contemporary and simplified
          theme. It is our hope that this Moodle server will help support our
          online education especially in this time of pandemic.
