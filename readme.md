npm i -g firebase-tools

firebase serve --only "functions,hosting"

to dos:
**user side**
- in monitoring form, when it is not yet the specific day, it should be read-only (for gab)
- "are you sure you want to save this?" in every save btn
**admin side**
- change ui for user setting
- dashboard -> whenever a name is clicked, it should redirect to another page, no more tabs (like the monitoring page)
- modify user detail page to have table for monitoring forms, click to see detail on another page
- modify user detail page to have table for contact tracing forms, click to see detail on another page

- !! IMPT !! specify only 1 admin in document for defense
